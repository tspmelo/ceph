>=13.1.0
--------

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).

* The JSON output of the ``osd find`` command has replaced the ``ip``
  field with an ``addrs`` section to reflect that OSDs may bind to
  multiple addresses.

* CephFS clients without the 's' flag in their authentication capability
  string will no longer be able to create/delete snapshots. To allow
  ``client.foo`` to create/delete snapshots in the ``bar`` directory of
  filesystem ``cephfs_a``, use command:

    - ``ceph auth caps client.foo mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs_a' mds 'allow rw, allow rws path=/bar'``

* The ``osd_heartbeat_addr`` option has been removed as it served no
  (good) purpose: the OSD should always check heartbeats on both the
  public and cluster networks.
